## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Next.js

Welcome to the world of Next.js! This guide will help you set up your project and get it running in no time. Let's dive in!

### 1. Install Dependencies
Before start navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run one of the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
